## Getting Started

To get started with the code in this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Clone the repository using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DanaPacatang/tkinter-gui-codemy
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

   Change to the project directory where the scripts are located:

   ```bash
   cd tkinter-gui-codemy
   ```
   
3. **Run the Python Scripts**

   The repository contains multiple Python scripts from the tutorial. You can run any script using the following command, replacing script_name.py with the name of the script you want to execute:

   ```bash
   python script_name.py
   ```
   
   Each script is a separate example from the tutorial. Run them individually to see the different functionalities covered in the course.

4. **Tkinter Installation**

   Tkinter is included with Python, but it must be selected during installation. When installing Python, ensure that the "tcl/tk and IDLE" checkbox is selected to include Tkinter. If you missed this step, you can install Tkinter later using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install tk
   ```
